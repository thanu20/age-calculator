 🎉 Age Calculator

This is a fun and interactive Age Calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhanced with Luxon and jQuery UI Datepicker.  
It helps users calculate their exact age in years, months, and days with a friendly, glowing message and smooth user interface.

I created this as a beginner-to-intermediate frontend project to explore DOM manipulation, date libraries, and custom datepickers. I also added custom styling, a background image, and animations to make it engaging and modern. 🥳
