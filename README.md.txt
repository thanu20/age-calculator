🎉 Age Calculator

This is a fun and interactive Age Calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It helps users calculate their exact age in years, months, and days just by selecting their date of birth.

I created this as a beginner-friendly frontend project to sharpen my web development skills and explore DOM manipulation in JavaScript. I also added custom styling, a background image, and a glowing animated result message to make the experience more engaging and fun! 🥳

 🚀 Features

- Simple and clean user interface
- Accurate age calculation based on today's date
- Cool background image and smooth styling
- Fun emoji-based messages and glowing animated text
- Fully responsive design — works well on both desktop and mobile



🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5 – for the structure
- CSS3 – for styling and layout
- JavaScript – for age calculation logic and interactivity
